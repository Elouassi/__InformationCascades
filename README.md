# __InformationCascades
Repository documenting development of simulation code for Dr. Tho Ngoc Le's doctoral thesis "Bayesian Observational Learrning: When More Information Can Fail".

This repository will contain three branches:
MATLAB - this branch will contain the MATLAB version of the simulation files. Initially, the code will	 will be completed and organized as .m files.
Python - this branch will contain the Python version of the simulation files. Once the simulations have	 been completed in MATLAB and merged with main, this branch will then reimplement the MATLAB code but
this time using python and the appropriate numerical libraries.
Main - this branch will contain the completed versions of the simulation files in both MATLAB and
python.
